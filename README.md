# 3D Terrain Generator

## Overview

This is a project which generates low-poly 3D terrain. I created this because I'm learning more about 3D graphics. To explain it simply, the code uses a noise function built into the Godot game engine to generate a height map and then maps that height map to a set of vertices generated in code. Surprisingly, the most challenging part for me was not the noise function but generating the vertices.

## Controls

You can use ESC to toggle whether the mouse is freed. When the mouse is locked, move it to turn the camera. You can use WASD to move around and SPACE and LEFT-CTRL to move up and down respectively. Holding shift will allow you to move around faster.
